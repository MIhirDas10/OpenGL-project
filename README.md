# OpenGL-project
Hey there, this is a game inspired by SAW. You will see a few concepts from the movie, but with a few creative changes made for the best interest of the game. 

# How to run the game

To run the game, you must download the OpenGL zip. Extract it. In a folder of your choosing, keep the folder you just extracted along with the other two files: `SAW - game file.py` and `new_bg.jpg`. Then go to VSCODE or any code compiler software and hit run. And voila, you got a running game.


# Controls

1. W/A/S/D  ->  for up/down/left/right movements
2. F  ->  First Person View (toggleable)
3. K  ->  picking up the key
4. P  ->  picking up the axe
5. C  ->  cutting your limbs
6. X  ->  exiting the game when won
7. Left Mouse click  ->  for answering quiz questions
8. Right Mouse click  ->  for zooming in

# Condition

1. To win the game you have to give a quiz and you will have to answer all the questions correctly
2. If you answer wrong then you have to pay and it's gonna cost you a limb. So, if you love your limbs, answer carefully.
3. There is a time limit, if you don't answer or cut your limbs in time, then the saw villain will stab you. And the game overs.
4. If you cut four of your limbs the game overs anyways.
5. You have to stay in range to do some tasks like picking up the axe or the key.
